WebFist implements WebFinger delegation for providers who don't
support WebFinger natively.

It takes advantage of the fact that all major providers DKIM-sign
their outgoing emails.

So if you have a Gmail, Facebook, Yahoo, Outlook, or whatever account,
you can email a server in the WebFist pool of servers, the server will
DKIM-verify it, parse it for a WebFinger delegation command, and then
encrypt your original email (with your email address as the key) and
then replicate the encrypted data across the network of WebFist servers.

Each WebFist node is then also a WebFinger server, so you can do
WebFinger lookups on gmail or facebook email addresses.

Consider it a WebFinger fallback.

One node is currently running at http://webfinger.org/

The plan is to have a big pool of WebFist servers, like NTP pools.
